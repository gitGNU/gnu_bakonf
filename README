Welcome.

bakonf is a tool designed to make backups of the configuration
files of a GNU/Linux or Unix-like system. Its aim is to use
various methods in order to reduce the size of the backup to a
reasonable minimum, in order to be useful for remote/unattended
servers, while still backing up enough to recreate the system.

The contents of the archives created contain enough information
so that a skilled sysadmin can restore the system to a working
state. Beside the actual information from the filesystem, the
extra that bakonf stores is (for Linux):
    - partition table
    - various /proc information
    - pci & usb device list

For other os-es, you must customize the configuration files.
