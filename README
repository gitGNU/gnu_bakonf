Welcome.

bakonf is a tool designed to make backups of the configuration
files of a GNU/Linux or Unix-like system. Its aim is to use
various methods in order to reduce the size of the backup to a
reasonable minimum, in order to be useful for remote/unattended
servers, while still backing up enough to recreate the system.

The contents of the archives created contain enough information
so that a skilled sysadmin can restore the system to a working
state. Beside the actual information from the filesystem, the
extra that bakonf stores is:
    - package list, so you known exactly what you had installed
    - uname information
    - partition table (not yet done, must choose how to configure
      what disk to scan)
